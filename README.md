Documenation and Instructions
---

<p>MS SQL Server Integration Services support two deployment models: 1) The project deployment model and 2) The legacy package deployment model, i.e. Data Transformation Services (DTS).</p>
<p>This Action Pack is intended to execute legacy SSIS Packages.</p>
<p>Please note that SSIS usually only accepts requests from Windows users who use Windows Authentication. Please make sure that the SQL Agent is configured accordingly.</p>
<p>The Action Pack requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows OS Agent</li>
<li>"dtexec" Utility</li>
</ul>
<p>See the following page for further information on the "dtexec" command: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/integration-services/packages/dtexec-utility">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/integration-services/packages/dtexec-utility</a></p>
